    <h1>Threads</h1>
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Threads are memory remains of ancient gods, scattered around the world the have been collected and used by heroes.
	</p>
	<h2>Concept</h2>
	<p>Threads can be found randomly while exploring dungeons and different challanges. A thread is permanent, collectable and can be assigned to a hero which will gift that hero with abilities.
	There is a varity of different schools and spell types that can be attained. Many of the threads come if different qualities. Threads can be traded, they are permanent and can be changed, a hero can equip several different threads at once.
	High usage of a thread might by chance evolve the thread to a higher quality version.
	</p>
	<h2>Properties</h2>
	<p>There are a few common properties that limits and balance the use of threads, making sure the gameplay remains varied. The high quality version of different threads useally means slight bonus on theese properties.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cast time - determing how long it takes to weave the thread, long cast time is a weakness and gives the enemy longer time to react to the spell</li>
		<li>Cooldown - determing how long it takes for the thread to be ready for use in the same fight, making sure the same spell isnt always spammed</li>
		<li>Cost - Some kind of power/mana cost to cast the spell</li>
	</ul>
